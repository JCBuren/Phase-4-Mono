# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
   
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
#  Random Team Sport
# Faker::Team.sport #=> "lacrosse"

# Random Team Name created from random US State (Faker::Address.state) prepended to a random Team Creature
# Faker::Team.name #=> "Oregon vixens"
# Faker::Name.name   
# Faker::PhoneNumber
#Faker::Internet.email
#Faker::Address
#Faker::Address.street_address
